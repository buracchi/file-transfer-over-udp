                         TFTP Multicast Option

Abstract

   This document describes a new TFTP option to allow multiple clients to receive the same file concurrently through the use of Multicast packets.

Multicast Option Specification

   The TFTP Read Request packet is modified to include the multicast
   option as follows:

      +--------+----~~----+---+--~~--+---+-----------+---+---+
      |  opc=1 | filename | 0 | mode | 0 | multicast | 0 | 0 |
      +--------+----~~----+---+--~~--+---+-----------+---+---+

   opc
      The opcode field contains a 1, for Read Requests.

   filename
      The name of the file to be read. This is a zero terminated field.

   mode
      The mode of the file transfer: "netascii" or "octet". This is a zero terminated field.

   multicast
      Request  for  multicast  transmission  of  the  file  option, "multicast" (case insensitive). This is a zero terminated field. The value for this option request is a string of zero length.

   If the server is willing to accept the multicast option, it sends an Option Acknowledgment (OACK) to the client including the multicast option.
   The OACK to the client will specify the multicast address and flag to indicate whether that client should send block acknowledgments (ACK).

     +-------+-----------+---+-------~~-------+---+
     |  opc  | multicast | 0 | addr, port, mc | 0 |
     +-------+-----------+---+-------~~-------+---+

   opc
      The  opcode  field  contains  the  number  6,  for  Option Acknowledgment.

   multicast
      Acknowledges the multicast option. This is a zero terminated field.

   addr
      The addr field contains the multicast IP address. This field is terminated with a comma.

   port
      The port field contains the destination port of the multicast packets. The use of Registered Port number 1758 (tftp-mcast) is recommended.
      This field is terminated with a comma.

   mc
      This field will be either 0 or 1, to tell the client whether it is the master client, that is, it is responsible for sending ACKs to the server. This is zero terminated field.

Data Transfer

   After the OACK is received by the client it will send an ACK for packet zero.
   With the multicast option being accepted this ACK will indicate to the server that the client wants the first packet.
   In other words the ACKs may now be seen as a request for the n+1th block of data.
   This enables each client to request any block within the file that it may be missing.

   To manage the data transfer the server will maintain a list of clients.
   Typically the oldest client on the list, from here on referred to as the Master Client, will be responsible for sending ACKs.
   When the master client is finished, the server will send another OACK to the next oldest client, telling it to start sending ACKs.
   Upon receipt of this OACK the new master client will send an ACK for the block immediately before the first block required to complete its download.

   Any subsequent clients can start receiving blocks of a file during a transfer and then request any missing blocks when that client becomes the master client.
   When the current master client is finished, the server will notify the next client with an OACK making it the new master client.
   The new master client can start requesting  missed packets.
   Each  client  must  terminate  the transfer by sending an acknowledgment of the last packet or by sending an error message to server.
   This termination can occur even if the client is not the master client.

   Any subsequent OACKs to a client may have an empty multicast address
   and port fields, since this information will already be held by that
   client. In the event a client fails to respond in a timely manner to
   a OACK enabling it as the master client, the server shall select the
   next oldest client to be the master client. The server shall
   reattempt to send a OACK to the non- responding client when the new
   master client is finished. The server may cease communication with a
   client after a reasonable number of attempts.

   Each transfer will be given a multicast address for use to distribute
   the data packets. Since there can be multiple servers on a given
   network or a limited number of addresses available to a given server,
   it is possible that their might be more than one transfer using a
   multicast address. To ensure that a client only accepts the correct
   packets, each transfer must use a unique port on the server. The
   source IP address and port number will identify the data packets for
   the transfer. Thus the server must send the unicast OACK packet to
   the client using the same port as will be used for sending the
   multicast data packets.

   At any point if a client, other than the master client, sends a ACK
   to the server, the server will respond with another OACK with the mc
   field holding a value of zero. If this client persists in sending
   erroneous ACKs, the server may send an error packet to the client,
   discontinuing the file transfer for that client.

   The server may also send unicast packets to a lone client to reduce
   adverse effects on other machines. As it is possible that machines
   may be forced to process many extraneous multicast packets when
   attempting to receive a single multicast address.
