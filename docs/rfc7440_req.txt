                         TFTP Windowsize Option

Abstract

   This document describes a TFTP option to negotiate a window size of consecutive blocks to send.

3.  Windowsize Option Specification

   The TFTP Read Request or Write Request packet is modified to include the windowsize option as follows.
   Note that all fields except "opc" MUST be ASCII strings followed by a zero byte.

      2B     string   1B   string   1B     string     1B   string   1B
   +-------+---~~---+----+---~~---+----+-----~~-----+----+---~~---+----+
   |  opc  |filename|  0 |  mode  |  0 | windowsize |  0 | #blocks|  0 |
   +-------+---~~---+----+---~~---+----+-----~~-----+----+---~~---+----+

   opc
      The opcode field contains either a 1 for Read Requests or a 2 for Write Requests.

   filename
      The name of the file to be read or written.

   mode
      The mode of the file transfer: "netascii" or "octet".

   windowsize
      The windowsize option, "windowsize" (case insensitive).

   #blocks
      The base-10 ASCII string representation of the number of blocks in a window.
      The valid values range MUST be between 1 and 65535 blocks, inclusive.
      The windowsize refers to the number of consecutive blocks transmitted before stopping and waiting for the reception of the acknowledgment of the last block transmitted.

   For example:

   +------+--------+----+-------+----+------------+----+----+----+
   |0x0001| foobar |0x00| octet |0x00| windowsize |0x00| 16 |0x00|
   +------+--------+----+-------+----+------------+----+----+----+

   is a Read Request for the file named "foobar" in octet transfer mode with a windowsize of 16 blocks (option blocksize is not negotiated in this example, the default of 512 Bytes per block applies).

   If the server is willing to accept the windowsize option, it sends an Option Acknowledgment (OACK) to the client.
   The specified value MUST be less than or equal to the value specified by the client.
   The client MUST then either use the size specified in the OACK or send an ERROR packet, with error code 8, to terminate the transfer.

   The reception of a data window with a number of blocks less than the negotiated windowsize is the final window.

4.  Traffic Flow and Error Handling

   The next diagram depicts a section of the traffic flow between the Data Sender (DSND) and the Data Receiver (DRCV) parties on a generic windowsize TFTP file transfer.

   The DSND MUST cyclically send to the DRCV the agreed windowsize consecutive data blocks before normally stopping and waiting for the
   ACK of the transferred window.
   The DRCV MUST send to the DSND the ACK of the last data block of the window in order to confirm a successful data block window reception.

   In the case of an expected ACK not timely reaching the DSND (timeout), the last received ACK SHALL set the beginning of the next windowsize data block window to be sent.

   In the case of a data block sequence error, the DRCV SHOULD notify the DSND by sending an ACK corresponding to the last data block
   correctly received.
   The notified DSND SHOULD send a new data block window whose beginning MUST be set based on the ACK received out of sequence.

   Traffic with windowsize = 1 MUST be equivalent to traffic specified by [RFC1350].

                    Including Errors and Error Recovery

6.  Congestion and Error Control

   The rate at which TFTP UDP datagrams are sent SHOULD follow the CC guidelines in Section 3.1 of [RFC5405].

   Implementations SHOULD always set a maximum number of retries for datagram retransmissions, imposing an appropriate threshold on error recovery attempts, after which a transfer SHOULD always be aborted to prevent pathological retransmission conditions.
