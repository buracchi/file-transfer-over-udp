                         TFTP Blocksize Option
Abstract

   This document describes a TFTP option which allows the client and server to negotiate a blocksize more applicable to the network medium.

Blocksize Option Specification

   The TFTP Read Request or Write Request packet is modified to include the blocksize option as follows.
   Note that all fields except "opc" are zero terminated.

      +-------+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+
      |  opc  |filename| 0 |  mode  | 0 | blksize| 0 | #octets| 0 |
      +-------+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+

      opc
         The opcode field contains either a 1, for Read Requests, or 2, for Write Requests.

      filename
         The name of the file to be read or written.

      mode
         The mode of the file transfer: "netascii", "octet", or "mail".

      blksize
         The Blocksize option, "blksize" (case in-sensitive).

      #octets
         The number of octets in a block, specified in ASCII.
         Valid values range between "8" and "65464" octets, inclusive.
         The blocksize refers to the number of data octets (it does not include the four octets of TFTP header).

   For example:

      +-------+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+
      |   1   | foobar | 0 | octet  | 0 | blksize| 0 |  1428  | 0 |
      +-------+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+

   is a Read Request, for the file named "foobar", in octet (binary) transfer mode, with a block size of 1428 octets (Ethernet MTU, less the TFTP, UDP and IP header lengths).

   If the server is willing to accept the blocksize option, it sends an Option Acknowledgment (OACK) to the client.
   The specified value must be less than or equal to the value specified by the client.
   The client must then either use the size specified in the OACK, or send an ERROR packet, with error code 8, to terminate the transfer.

   The reception of a data packet with a data length less than the negotiated blocksize is the final packet.
